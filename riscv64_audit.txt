Audit for Existing riscv64 Support
==================================

Date: 2025-07-03

Result:
-------

No files, scripts, or configuration files in the repository currently mention or target "riscv64" (case-insensitive).

- Searched for "riscv64" in all files: no results found.
- Searched for "riscv": no results found in file contents, though some filenames suggest riscv support (e.g., Dockerfile.riscv, build-docker-riscv.sh), but these do not mention riscv64.

Conclusion:
-----------

There is currently no explicit riscv64 support in the codebase.
