Description: Docker Engine for RISC-V64 architecture
 Docker is an open-source project to easily create lightweight, portable,
 self-sufficient containers from any application. The same container that a
 developer builds and tests on a laptop can run at scale, in production, on
 VMs, bare metal, OpenStack clusters, public clouds and more.
 .
 This package contains the Docker Engine daemon (dockerd) and docker-proxy,
 built natively for RISC-V64 architecture from the official Moby project
 source code.
 .
 This is an unofficial build specifically for RISC-V64 systems running
 Debian Trixie.

Description: Container runtime for RISC-V64 architecture
 containerd is an industry-standard container runtime with an emphasis on
 simplicity, robustness and portability. It is available as a daemon for
 Linux and Windows, which can manage the complete container lifecycle of
 its host system.
 .
 This package contains containerd and containerd-shim-runc-v2, built
 natively for RISC-V64 architecture.

Description: OCI container runtime for RISC-V64 architecture
 runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers according to the
 OCI specification. It is designed to be as minimal as possible, and is
 the reference implementation of the OCI runtime specification.
 .
 This package contains the runc binary, built natively for RISC-V64
 architecture.
