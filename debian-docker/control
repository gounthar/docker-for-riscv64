Description: Docker Engine for RISC-V64 architecture
 Docker is an open-source project to easily create lightweight, portable,
 self-sufficient containers from any application. The same container that a
 developer builds and tests on a laptop can run at scale, in production, on
 VMs, bare metal, OpenStack clusters, public clouds and more.
 .
 This package contains Docker Engine v28.5.1 daemon (dockerd) and
 docker-proxy, built natively for RISC-V64 architecture from the official
 Moby project source code.
 .
 Built on BananaPi F3 running Armbian Trixie.
