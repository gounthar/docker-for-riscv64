Description: Docker Engine for RISC-V64 architecture
 Docker is an open-source project to easily create lightweight, portable,
 self-sufficient containers from any application. The same container that a
 developer builds and tests on a laptop can run at scale, in production, on
 VMs, bare metal, OpenStack clusters, public clouds and more.
 .
 This package contains the Docker Engine daemon (dockerd) and docker-proxy,
 built natively for RISC-V64 architecture from the official Moby project
 source code.
 .
 This is an unofficial build specifically for RISC-V64 systems running
 Debian Trixie.
