Description: Concurrent, cache-efficient, and Dockerfile-agnostic builder toolkit
 BuildKit is a toolkit for converting source code to build artifacts in an
 efficient, expressive, and repeatable manner. It is the next-generation
 container image builder, designed to be the backend for Docker Buildx and
 multi-platform builds.
 .
 Features include:
  - Automatic garbage collection
  - Extendable frontend formats
  - Concurrent dependency resolution
  - Efficient instruction caching
  - Build cache import/export
  - Nested build job invocations
  - Distributable workers
  - Multiple output formats
  - Pluggable architecture
  - Execution without root privileges
 .
 This package contains:
  - buildkitd: BuildKit daemon (server)
  - buildctl: BuildKit CLI client
 .
 This is the RISC-V64 port of BuildKit, providing native support for
 the RISC-V 64-bit architecture.
