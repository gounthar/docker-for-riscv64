Description: Tiny but valid init for containers (RISC-V64)
 Tini is the simplest init you could think of. It spawns a single
 child process and waits for it to exit while reaping zombies and
 performing signal forwarding.
 .
 Tini is used by Docker with the --init flag to properly handle
 process signals and prevent zombie processes in containers.
 .
 This package provides both tini and tini-static pre-built binaries
 for RISC-V64 architecture.
