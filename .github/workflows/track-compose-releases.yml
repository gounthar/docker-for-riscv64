          **Status:** Build automatically triggered

          The compose-weekly-build workflow has been started automatically.
          Expected completion time: ~15-20 minutes on self-hosted riscv64 runner

          **Monitor build progress:**
          \`\`\`bash
          gh run list --workflow=compose-weekly-build.yml --limit 1
          gh run watch
          \`\`\`

          **Expected release:** compose-v${CLEAN_VERSION}-riscv64

          **Upstream release notes:** https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/tag/$LATEST

          This issue will track the build progress. Close it once the release is published.
