          New BuildKit release detected: **$LATEST**

          **Status:** Build automatically triggered

          The buildkit-weekly-build workflow has been started automatically.
          Expected completion time: ~10-15 minutes

          **Monitor build progress:**
          \`\`\`bash
          gh run list --workflow=buildkit-weekly-build.yml --limit 1
          gh run watch
          \`\`\`

          **Expected release:** buildkit-${LATEST}-riscv64

          **Upstream release notes:** https://github.com/moby/buildkit/releases/tag/$LATEST

          **Components to be built:**
          - buildkitd binary
          - buildctl binary
          - BuildKit container image (ghcr.io/gounthar/buildkit-riscv64:${LATEST}-riscv64)

          **Integration:**
          This BuildKit image will be compatible with Docker Buildx for multi-platform builds.

          ## Verification Checklist

          After the build completes:
          - [ ] Release created: buildkit-${LATEST}-riscv64
          - [ ] Binaries uploaded (buildkitd, buildctl)
          - [ ] Container image pushed to GHCR
          - [ ] Test with Docker Buildx: \`docker buildx create --driver-opt image=ghcr.io/gounthar/buildkit-riscv64:${LATEST}-riscv64\`
          - [ ] Multi-platform build test passes

          This issue will track the build progress. Close it once the release is published and verified.
