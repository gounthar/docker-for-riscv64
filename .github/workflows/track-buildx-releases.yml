          New Docker Buildx release detected: **$LATEST**

          **Status:** Build automatically triggered

          The buildx-weekly-build workflow has been started automatically.
          Expected completion time: ~35-40 minutes on self-hosted riscv64 runner

          **Monitor build progress:**
          \`\`\`bash
          gh run list --workflow=buildx-weekly-build.yml --limit 1
          gh run watch
          \`\`\`

          **Expected release:** buildx-v${CLEAN_VERSION}-riscv64

          **Upstream release notes:** https://github.com/docker/buildx/releases/tag/$LATEST

          **What is Docker Buildx?**
          Docker Buildx is a CLI plugin that extends the docker build command with the full BuildKit features, including:
          - Multi-platform builds (--platform flag)
          - Advanced caching strategies
          - Build-time secrets and SSH forwarding
          - Remote builder support

          This issue will track the build progress. Close it once the release is published.
